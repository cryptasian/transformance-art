                  My journey has taken me across continents and cultures, cultivating a rich tapestry of musical mastery and innovative expression. With roots in esteemed institutions, a thirst for out-of-the-box ideas, and over four decades of experience, I've honed my craft - earning accolades and igniting passions along the way.<br><br>
                  My experiences range from accompanying world-renowned vocalists and leading chamber ensembles to securing approval from the Chinese government to collaborate with a choir of Miao minority singers in staging Handel's Messiah at the Yunnan Minority Village, delivering a worship concert to an audience of over 3,000. I'm more than just a virtuoso pianist – I'm a multifaceted artist, dancer, and educator, dedicated to empowering others through the transformative power of art.<br><br>
                  As the Founder and President of Transformance Art, my life is a testimony to the benefits of art, and I aim to share this with others through a vibrant hub where creative artists can connect and use their talents to uplift and inspire others. I want to see transformance artists build bridges through music and art and create a world where artistic expression will act as a powerful catalyst for personal and societal transformation.

                <p id="philipwharton-bio" class="text-overflow-clamp">
                  Few artists enjoy such high praise for both of their disciplines as composer/violinist Philip Wharton. Of his playing, <i>The New York Times</i> proclaimed, “a rousing performance!” and <i>The Waterloo Courier</i> wrote, “a golden tone with breathtaking execution.” His compositions, heralded from coast to coast, are described by the <i>New York Concert Review</i> as, “…decidedly contemporary…both engaging and accessible.” Writing from symphony to song, past seasons saw the Santa Fe Opera’s remounting of <i>Two Saintes Caught in the Same Act</i> as part of their apprentice scenes program, the Grammy-nominated Borealis Wind Quintet perform his Quintet on their concert tours, his chamber symphony, <i>Passing Season</i> performed by regional orchestras, premiere of his Symphony, his tribute to Shakespeare’s 450th birthday, a song cycle entitled Fools, and concerts with Grammy-nominated soprano, Caroline Worra. Other projects include collaborations with author Janet Burroway and illustrator John Vernon Lord to create musical settings of their books for children: <i>The Giant Jam Sandwich, The Truck on the Track</i>, and a vocal-monodrama, <i>The Perfect Pig</i>. Recent recordings include Albany Records’ release of his Flute Sonata—performed by flutist, Katherine Fink, and pianist Rose Grace, Crescent Phase Records’ release of his Woodwind Quintet—performed by the Madera Woodwind Quintet, and Kenneth Thompkins’ (principal Detroit Symphony Orchestra) recording of his Alto-Trombone Sonata. Expect to see the release of a CD by Elizabeth Sombart with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the coming year.

                  Carla Thelen Hanson is garnering attention for exciting and vocally thrilling performances of opera's leading heroines throughout the country of her recent debut of Cio-Cio San in Puccini's Madama Butterfly the InForum declared: "the singer's star is shining bright...". Her debut in the role of Desdemona in Verdi's Otello at the Utah Festival Opera the Salt Lake City Tribune exclaimed "Hanson’s vocal range, exquisite control and emotional depth culminated in "Willow Song"; the sublime "Ave Maria" that followed was a masterpiece of tenderness and vulnerability. She also showed indomitable strength, defying Otello’s brutal efforts to make her confess a nonexistent sin in the final duet." Of her New York City Opera debut as Puccini's Tosca, The New York Times noted, "Ms. Hanson made a strong debut as Tosca, by turns fiery and vulnerable, her voice agreeably dark in its middle range and sufficiently full on top" and the New Yorker exclaims "her dark-grained, strongly felt "Vissi d'arte" sailed right up to the uppermost balcony." Of her Tosca at Utah Festival Opera the Desert News proclaimed her “outstanding” and her “Vissi d’arte” “heart piercing”.  Of her recent Fidelio the weekly InForum noted “Hers is a voice of great power and beauty and she essayed the difficult music with aplomb. Her first act aria was so beautifully done that it received a sustained three-minute ovation at the Friday performance." She received equal praise for portrayals of Maddalena de Coigny in Andrea Chenier for Mobile Opera, as well as the title roles of Ariadne auf Naxos and Norma, both with Union Ave Opera Theatre. For Seattle Opera’s 2009 Ring Cycles, she covered the 3 soprano Valkyries in Die Walkuere.<br><br>On the concert stage, Ms. Hanson performs with noted symphony orchestras across the country including acclaimed performances of Barber’s Hermit Songs, Beethoven's 9th Symphony, Mass in C, Missa Solemnis, Handel’s Messiah and Ode to Queen Anne, Harbison’s Mirabai Songs, Libby Larsen's Try Me, Good King Mozart’s Exultate Jubilate, Orff’s Carmina Burana, Rutter's Feel the Spirit, Strauss’s Vier Letzte Lieder, Verdi’s Requiem, Vivaldi’s Gloria and Motet, and Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder.<br><br>Upcoming she sings Rosalinda in J. Strauss's Die Fledermaus with Nashville Opera, a German Art Song recital series throughout the Mid-West, and will debut a recording Chanson d'amour, a CD of song of love through out the world with her long time collaborator, Ainhoa Urkijo.
