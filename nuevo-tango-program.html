			<p style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="font-teal-light">Astor Piazzolla</span> (1921-1992) is widely recognized as the greatest composer and ambassador of tango music, who made it his life mission to bring the signature music genre of Argentina from the dance floors onto the concert stages of Europe and America. His works revolutionized the traditional tango into a new style of Nuevo Tango, a new musical style that incorporated classical music with its technicality and
				musical structure, and jazz, with its unique syncopations and improvisatory elements. This musical fusion reflects Piazzolla’s life story; born in Argentina in 1921, he spent his early childhood in Buenos Aires, where he heard the old tango style played in the streets; as a teenager, his family lived in New York City, where he heard the top jazz musicians of the 1930s, and as an adult, he studied classical composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, who encouraged him to remain loyal to his roots in the tango style. 
				Piazzolla created a completely new genre by merging tango, jazz, and classical music together. He was severely criticized and even death threats for his tango reforms in the 1960s. But the rest of the world embraced Piazzolla’s works. His new tango music became very popular in Europe and America among audiences and performers. His tangos are vastly transcribed for various formations and orchestras.

		<div class="col-full">
			<p style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="font-teal-light">Histoire du Tango</span> 
				(History of Tango) was originally composed for flute and guitar in 1986 to convey the history and evolution of the tango in four movements. KnoxTrio will be playing two movements.
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">“Cafe 1930”</span> 
				is slower and melancholy, reflecting the public’s shift from dancing to listening.
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">“Nightclub 1960”</span> 
				combines the tango with the bossa nova genre that was popular at that time.

			<p style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="font-teal-light">Escualo</span> 
				(Shark) was composed in 1979 for Piazzolla’s colleague and tango violinist Fernando Suarez Paz. This short and energetic piece is an homage to Piazzolla’s favorite hobby– fishing in Uruguay.

			<p style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="font-teal-light">Oblivion</span> 
				was composed in Rome in 1982 for a soundtrack of Mario Bellochio’s film Enrico IV. It is in the style of Milonga, a style of music that heavily influenced Tango. It is one of Piazzolla’s most well-known, achingly beautiful, and haunting compositions.

			<p style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="font-teal-light">Libertango</span> 
				is one of Piazzolla’s most popular masterpieces. It has been arranged for countless instruments and combinations. The title of this piece symbolizes his liberation from the traditional tango style.

		<div class="col-full">
			<p style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="font-teal-light">Four Seasons of Buenos Aires</span>, 
				inspired by the Four Seasons of Vivaldi, composed over a six-year period (1965-70) is a set of four tango compositions, originally written for quintet and bandoneon. Each tango has a unique blend of Bach, Romantic, Impressionistic & Jazz. “Autumn” is the busy time of the year, “Winter”, with its quietness and desolation, “Spring” is a lively fugue, and “Summer” is outdoor music seasoned with street noises.
