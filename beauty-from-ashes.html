                <p>Seven Songs for a Dead Son: <i>"The Tim Poems"</i> by Janet Burroway set to music by composer Philip Wharton.</p>

                    <p><i>"When I first met Janet, she was just reengaging with the world after her son's suicide from
                    PTSD. She made the decision from two choices: she could give up or write. She's a writer so she
                    chose to write. In The Tim Poems, I feel a mother's sense of profound loss. Without clinical
                    intent, some hint at the stages of grief and others more explicitly: shock in Roadkill, bargaining
                    in Monologue, and acceptance in Terra Cotta. The poems never try to answer the question
                    "why?!" - for even though the question hovers always, there is no answer - just working
                    through loss, carrying on, and even finding humor in the ironies of living."</i></p>

                <h3>Dance Performances</h3>
                <h4 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;"><i>Kyrie Eleison</i></h4>
                <p>This piece, "Kyrie Eleison," is rooted in Romans Chapter 8. It explores the profound spiritual life that conquers both physical and spiritual death, and the firm promise given to those who put their hope in God.</p>
                <p>The first section confronts separation, showing what life is like apart from Jesus and without hope, specifically through the raw reality of suicidal thoughts and actions. The music includes "Kyrie Eleison," a plea meaning "Lord, Have Mercy." This dance is an appeal for God's forgiveness and healing, truths made possible by Jesus and still relevant today. All the struggles tied to suicide come from a fallen world; suicide itself is a stark picture of the lies from creation's fall. A spiritual life separated from our Creator mirrors physical death. Without Jesus's promise, we were dead in our trespasses, facing this world's trials with no hope for freedom, future, or real life.</p>
                <p>The second section fully reveals the promise found in Romans Chapter 8. This passage comes alive through contemporary dance, reflecting God's powerful voice and presence washing over us like water. It speaks to the Holy Spirit's supernatural power, interceding for us, bringing ultimate victory over life and death, and offering abundant life and hope to those who put their faith in Jesus.</p>
                <p>I invite you to experience God's presence and be encouraged. Know that you are uniquely called to His purposes, and the Holy Spirit empowers you to walk in healing and victory. As Romans 8:37-38 (TPT) says: "Yet even in the midst of all all these things, we triumph over them all, for God has made us to be more than conquerors, and his demonstrated love is our glorious victory over everything. So now I live with the confidence that there is nothing in the universe with the power to separate us from God's love. I'm convinced that his love will triumph over death, life's troubles, fallen angels, or dark rulers in the heavens. There is nothing in our present or future circumstances that can weaken his love."</p>

                            <p>Beauty from Ashes comes at an uncanny time in my life. September in years' past have held my own struggles with suicide and suicidal ideations. My first experience considering suicide was sophomore year of college. Life seemed increasingly vain, short lived, and meaningless, especially if death was the end. Through these trenches of despair I learned the beauty of life by its brevity. Thus, there was a certain mercy that creeped into the foundation of my existence and life. Second, September of 2021 had me deconstructing false narratives and names I believed about myself. Being completely undone and unraveled, I was at the end of myself. Here God stepped in and rebuilt me according to who He says I am.</p>
                            <p>Each time, art was an outlet to process and engage with these depths of darkness. And now I get to paint for this event; shining light, beauty, and hope that even the darkness succumbs to light and color.</p>

                <p>
                    Abigail Tardy is so grateful to be emceeing this beautiful event for the evening. She is a junior at University of Tennessee majoring in Journalism & Media, but performance art is where her heart lies. Her own connection to the arts aided her own struggles with a deep depression. She is a singer, actress, dancer, and photographer. She has performed recently as Chava in Fiddler on the Roof (Wordplayers), Claudette/Diane/Charlotte in Walk, Don't Ride! (Wordplayers), Soeur St. Charles in Les Dialogues des Carmelites (UTOT), and the Narrator in The Journey: A Pilgrim's Progress (Gregory Tardy Tentet). She hopes everyone will be touched by the performances and art seen this evening.

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12" style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
            <p>Music, dance, painting, and poetry are powerful mediums for expressing one's deepest emotions. Whether navigating the journey through depression and overcoming suicidal thoughts, surviving the loss of a loved one, or any stage in between, art serves as a vital tool for communication. It helps people find hope, healing, and restoration.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Beauty from Ashes is our first Meraki Project. Meraki [may-rah-kee] is a Greek word that means "to do something with soul, creativity, or love; to put something of yourself in your work". The Meraki Projects will be a series of expressive artistic experiences that will promote hope, healing, and restoration. Each project will have a specific focus with the goal of bringing the experiences to cities around the world.</p>
            <p>We chose a project centered around suicide survival and healing because we are living in a time of mental health crisis, and we want to be a conduit for hope, healing, and restoration - starting in Knoxville, TN, and shining throughout cities across the world.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More than <strong>800,000</strong> people die due to suicide each year</li>
                <li>A person dies by suicide <strong>every 11 minutes</strong> in the U.S.</li>
                <li>Suicide is the <strong>2nd leading cause</strong> of death in the U.S. for <strong>ages 10-14 and 25-34</strong></li>
                <li>Youth and young adults <strong>ages 10-24</strong> account for <strong>15% of all suicides</strong></li>
                <li>Males account for <strong>77.97%</strong> of all U.S. suicides</li>
                <li>Veterans are at a <strong>57% higher</strong> risk of suicide than their non-Veteran peers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These heartbreaking statistics are contrasted by statistics that shine a light of hope:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More than 90%</strong> of people who survive a suicide attempt do not go on to die by suicide. This demonstrates that intervention, support, and time can significantly alter a person's trajectory.</li>
                <li><strong>Nearly 75%</strong> of U.S. adults do not make additional suicide attempts. National, lifelong studies have shown that recovery involves not just the absence of future attempts, but also improvements in key areas of life, such as being married, employed, and having strong social connections.</li>
                <li>Suicide attempt survivors often find profound meaning in helping others by using their own lived experience to educate communities and emphasize that recovery is possible.</li>
                <li>Suicide loss survivors also find healing in transforming their pain into purpose by sharing their story, finding others who understand their grief, and helping others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beauty from Ashes is a concert that focuses on the hope that exists in the courageous choice of survival by sharing the stories of suicide survivors.</p>
            <p>Join us for an artistic evening where stories of suicide survival are told through music, dance, and art.</p>
